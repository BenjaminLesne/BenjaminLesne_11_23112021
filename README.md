# Kasa

Kasa is a C2C application for renting apartments. Project 11 of the OpenClassrooms "Front End Developer" course. For this project I'm using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The project was requested in class components, but I disagree with this choice.

**PROJECT GOALS**:

- Creating components with React
- Develop the routes of a web application with React Router
- Initialize a web application with a framework

This project is part of the OpenClassrooms [Front-End Developer](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/314-developpeur-front-end) course. The code is freely reusable, but the images / logo / figma mock-up do not belong to me.

If you are also an OC student, you can freely draw inspiration from my work, but I obviously do not recommend copying parts of it.
